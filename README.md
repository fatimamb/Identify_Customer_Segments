# Identify Customer Segments Project

### Project Description

This project is a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.In this project, I have worked with real-life data provided to us by AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. 
Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 
I had to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.
Then I have used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.

### Data:

AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. Youâ€™ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

- The files available for the project are:

1. Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
2. Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
3. Data_Dictionary.md: Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
4. AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv: Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.

based on the Terms & Conditions of Udacity I can' t download and reuse the data.
